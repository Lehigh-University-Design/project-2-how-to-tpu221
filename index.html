      <p><strong>GO-BETWIXT!</strong> was created as I was sitting at my bedroom desk, attending a high school Zoom class during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a broken Christmas ornament and my imagination cured my boredom by knocking the bells around the table. In no time, I had created rules and was playing with my friends and Family. I've enhanced the gameplay, written rules, and gone through dozens of rounds of focus groups and prototypes. Currently, GO-BETWIXT is at a market-ready level and is being sold in two local retail locations.</p>

        <p>With the table now scattered with balls, the first player (according to the progression) will use 
        thier paddle hit one of the bells that is the same color as thier paddle. 
        The goal is to hit thier bell in between the 2 bells of the next player in progression. ex. Red player hits thier bell in between the blue players bells. Imagine there is an invisible line between the blue bells and cross that line with your red bell.</p>

        <img src="css/assests/elimination.png" alt="Player eliminating tokens">
        <p>When someone hits thier bell and it fails to go between, the player was that was not gone between can eliminate them. If they hit thier own bell into thier other own bell it is a succesful elimination 
        ex. red does not go between blue - so blue hit thier blue bell into thier other blue bell. When eliminated remove your bells from the table.
        Note. If you miss an elimination shot the next player in progression can eliminate them. 
      Note. If your bell is ever hit of the table, by yourself or another player, you are out.
    Note. If someone in the middle of the progression is eliminated first just skip that color in the progression.</p>

          <li>Because a player is eliminated when their last token rolls off the table, itâ€™s sometimes strategic to use the edge and keep your aim low for better roll control.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Because a player is eliminated when their bell rolls off the table, it’s sometimes strategic to try to knock them off.</li>
          <li>If you successfully hit a bell off the table and your bells stays on, that next person in the progression cannot eliminate you because you had an elimination.</li>
          <li><strong>The act of knocking someone off the table counts as a successful turn but can be very risky.</strong></li>

  <ul>
          <li>There may be cases where intentionally missing a shot can be beneficial.</li>
          <li>If the person after you in the progression has a hard elimination shot you could hit your bells close together so when the progression comes back around the person that has to go through you has a very hard shot. A safe miss can sometimes be the smarter move.</li>
          <li>Think two steps ahead—if the person playing after you has a very hard shot, you can eliminate them indirectly.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>All a player has to do to be safe from elination is "break the plane".</li>
          <li> This creates an explotable loophole. If a players bell is already in the plane that they must go between they can lightly tap thier bell and stay in the plane. This counts as a succesful turn</li>
